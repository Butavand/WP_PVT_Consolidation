# WP_PVT_Consolidation

Word Pair Task Interspersed with PVT
This repository contains the implementation of a Word Pair Task (WPT) interspersed with the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT). The encoding and testing phases are conducted independently.

Task Phases
1. First Round
The initial phase involves encoding followed by a 3-minute PVT session.

Encoding: Participants learn word pairs.
3-minute PVT: Participants complete a PVT session.
2. Additional Rounds
If additional rounds are required based on different learning criteria, they follow the same structure as the first round but with modified instructions.

Encoding: As per the first round.
3-minute PVT: As per the first round.
3. Test Phase
The final phase involves a 3-minute PVT session followed by a testing session.

3-minute PVT: Participants complete another PVT session.
Testing: Participants are tested on the word pairs learned during the encoding phase.
Task Variations
There are two different word pair lists available to choose from for the task.
